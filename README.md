# ðŸ“Š Triad Census & Significance Profile in Directed Graphs

This Python module performs a **triad census** on a directed network represented as an adjacency matrix. It also computes the **Triad Significance Profile (TSP)** by comparing the real network to randomized versions preserving degree distributions.

- Generate random directed graphs
- Convert between adjacency matrices and edge lists
- Degree-preserving network randomization using edge swaps
- Compute triad significance profiles (Z-scores)
- Clean, modular, and well-documented code
